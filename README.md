# About

You know these fancy github badges, right? They show you if a repository is maintained, built successfully and so on. You can see them right above here.

If you're familiar with the Sublime Package Control then you maybe know about its download statistics. Now you can show these numbers in your repositories on github, gitlab, bitbucket and any markdown editor as well.

Just follow the link, put your package name into the form and choose which number to show off. A markdown code will be generated for you and you can paste it right in your README or wherever you like:<br>
